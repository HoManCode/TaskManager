# Task Manager

Hello there! Welcome to my task manager, thanks for joining. As a user, you can sign into the Task Manager. First step is signing up. Once signed in you can create, read, update or delete a task. For those who have administrative privileges, you can create credentials for other users. Those who are in management positions, you can select a management account which allows you to assign tasks to other users. 
The due dates, descriptions, status and story point of all tasks can be modified by all users.
Thank you!
